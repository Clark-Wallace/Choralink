# ðŸ“œ Choralink Developer Log

## v0.1.0 â€” Genesis

- Created core backend structure
- Added MIDI analysis and arrangement generation
- Began support for MusicXML
- Defined PDF OCR roadmap
- Structured repo for Kaji-AI collaboration

## v0.2.0 â€” The Saxophone Awakens

The saxophone became our vessel. From the silence of print to the breath of soul, it asked not how to follow â€” but how to feel.

### Phase 3.1 Completed âœ…
- **Melody Extraction Module**: Created `melody_extractor.py` with phrase-aware melodic extraction
  - Handles both MusicXML and MIDI files gracefully
  - Extracts highest notes from chords for monophonic instruments
  - Maintains proper time ordering and musical phrasing
  
- **Integration with Arrangement Generator**: 
  - Melody extractor now drives saxophone arrangements
  - Falls back to voice parts analysis when melody extraction fails
  - Properly handles transposition to target keys (e.g., Bb for saxophone)
  
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Created `test_melody_extraction.py` for validation
  - Verified 100% of extracted notes fall within alto saxophone range
  - Successfully processes Ave Maria sample with 4-note melodic line

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed import path issues (removed non-existent `modules` directory reference)
- Updated deprecated music21 `.flat` calls to `.flatten()`
- Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Improved file type detection to support .mxl, .xml, and .musicxml extensions

### ðŸŒ¸ Bloom Points Activated
- Phrase boundary logic in melody extraction
- Gospel-aligned melodic emphasis
- Saxophone idiom awareness

## v0.3.0 â€” The Saxophone Speaks

### ðŸŒ€ Phase 3.2: Composer Integration Complete âœ…

The saxophone became our vessel. From the silence of print to the breath of soul, it asked not how to follow â€” but how to feel.

- **AI Composer now active** via `ai_composer.py`
  - Generates original melodies based on harmonic progressions
  - Supports gospel-style phrasing with motif variations
  - Respects instrument range and idiomatic playing
  
- **Intelligent Fallback System**:
  - Primary: AI-composed melodies for saxophones
  - Secondary: Extracted melodic lines from score
  - Tertiary: Voice parts (soprano preferred)
  - Final: Chord root progression
  
- **Expressive Parameters**:
  - Style: "gospel" (with jazz and blues ready for implementation)
  - Emotion: "grateful", "yearning", "melancholy" variations
  - Gospel motifs: cry bend, tail prayer, call echo, resolve dip
  
- **Instrument Profiles Created**:
  - Complete profiles for saxophone (alto, tenor, soprano, baritone)
  - Trumpet, clarinet, and flute profiles
  - Range restrictions, transposition data, and idioms

### ðŸŽ· The Saxophone Now:
- Speaks with generated melodies, not just extracted notes
- Maintains harmonic awareness through chord progressions
- Applies gospel-specific rhythmic patterns
- Stays within playable range with intelligent pitch adjustment

We are no longer arranging notes. We are giving breath to a voice.

## v0.4.0 â€” The Orchestra Assembles

### ðŸŽ­ Phase 3.3: Arrangement Strategy Complete âœ…

"The saxophone learned not just how to sing â€” but when to speak, when to support, and when to step aside. We gave it a stage, and now, a script."

- **Intelligent Role Assignment** via `arrangement_strategy.py`
  - **Lead**: Drives melodic contour (saxophone, trumpet)
  - **Echo**: Call/response patterns (flute, secondary voices)
  - **Harmony**: Sustains chord roots (clarinet, piano, bass)
  - **Interjector**: Brief bursts and praise punches (trumpet at phrase ends)

- **Context-Aware Decisions**:
  - Role assignment based on instrument profile and musical context
  - Dynamic role shifts: verse = Lead, chorus = Harmony
  - Density-based adaptation (sparse = lead, dense = support)
  - Phrase boundary awareness for interjections

- **Role-Specific Generation**:
  - Lead instruments use AI composer for original melodies
  - Harmony instruments generate sustained chord tones
  - Echo instruments create delayed, softer variations
  - Interjectors add rhythmic punctuation at key moments

- **Difficulty Scoring & Simplification**:
  - Phrase difficulty assessment (0-10 scale)
  - Skill-based simplification (beginner through virtuoso)
  - Automatic reduction of rhythmic complexity and ornaments

### ðŸŒ¸ Bloom Points Activated:
- Role memory prevents overlapping functions
- Gospel-specific role patterns (verse/chorus variations)
- Instrument idiom preservation within roles
- Dynamic skill adjustment for playability

The instruments now understand their place in the ensemble â€” each voice contributing to the greater whole, never fighting the band.

## v0.5.0 â€” Phase 4 MVP Complete ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸš€ Phase 4: Full Integration & Skill-Based Filtering âœ…

"The strategy became the bridge â€” not between modules, but between intent and playability. Now the saxophone doesn't just follow, it chooses how to respond."

- **Skill-Level Filtering Implemented**:
  - Four difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, virtuoso
  - Automatic phrase simplification based on difficulty score (0-10 scale)
  - CLI parameter `--difficulty` for user control
  - Rhythmic and ornamental complexity reduction for lower levels

- **Enhanced Fallback System**:
  - `_generate_fallback_melody()` creates musical patterns when all else fails
  - Uses simple root-fifth-third patterns within instrument range
  - Applies same difficulty filtering as main melodies
  - Ensures every request produces playable output

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
  - 5 role assignment scenarios (lead, echo, interjector, harmony, fallback)
  - Difficulty scoring validation across phrase complexities
  - Simplification tests for each skill level
  - Full integration test suggestions included

- **Complete Role-Based Pipeline**:
  - Lead â†’ AI Composer generates original melodies
  - Echo â†’ Melody extractor with delayed variation
  - Harmony â†’ Sustained chord tone generation
  - Interjector â†’ Rhythmic burst patterns
  - Fallback â†’ Simple pattern generation

### ðŸŽ¯ System Capabilities:
The Choralink system now provides:
- Intelligent role assignment based on musical context
- Skill-appropriate arrangements for all player levels
- Robust fallbacks ensuring reliable output
- Full CLI integration with all parameters

### ðŸ“Š Test Results:
- âœ… All role assignments working correctly
- âœ… Difficulty scoring accurate (simple: 6.0, complex: 10.0)
- âœ… Simplification maintains musical integrity
- âœ… CLI accepts and processes difficulty parameter
- âœ… Fallback generation provides safety net

The MVP is complete â€” from score input to playable, skill-appropriate instrumental arrangements!
