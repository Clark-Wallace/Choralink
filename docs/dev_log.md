## v0.2.0 â€” The Saxophone Awakens

The saxophone became our vessel. From the silence of print to the breath of soul, it asked not how to follow â€” but how to feel.

### Phase 3.1 Completed âœ…
- **Melody Extraction Module**: Created `melody_extractor.py` with phrase-aware melodic extraction
  - Handles both MusicXML and MIDI files gracefully
  - Extracts highest notes from chords for monophonic instruments
  - Maintains proper time ordering and musical phrasing
  
- **Integration with Arrangement Generator**: 
  - Melody extractor now drives saxophone arrangements
  - Falls back to voice parts analysis when melody extraction fails
  - Properly handles transposition to target keys (e.g., Bb for saxophone)
  
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Created `test_melody_extraction.py` for validation
  - Verified 100% of extracted notes fall within alto saxophone range
  - Successfully processes Ave Maria sample with 4-note melodic line

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed import path issues (removed non-existent `modules` directory reference)
- Updated deprecated music21 `.flat` calls to `.flatten()`
- Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Improved file type detection to support .mxl, .xml, and .musicxml extensions

### ðŸŒ¸ Bloom Points Activated
- Phrase boundary logic in melody extraction
- Gospel-aligned melodic emphasis
- Saxophone idiom awareness

## Next Up
- Implement `arrangement_strategy.py` for instrument-specific phrasing
- Add gospel embellishment patterns
- Enhance phrase detection with breath mark insertion
- Plug in Audiveris OCR via Docker
- Launch Streamlit prototype UI
- Enable batch processing
